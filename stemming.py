               In linguistic morphology and information retrieval,
               stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem,
               base or root formâ€”generally a written word form. The stem need not be identical to the morphological root of the word;
               it is usually sufficient that related words map to the same stem, even if this stem is not in itself a valid root.
               
               
               Algorithms for stemming have been studied in computer science since the 1960s.
               Many search engines treat words with the same stem as synonyms as a kind of query expansion,
               a process called conflation.

               A computer program or subroutine that stems word may be called a stemming program, stemming algorithm,
               or stemmer"""
